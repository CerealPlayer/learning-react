# React Learning Path

These are all the projects I took to learn React while taking the 
[Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on the matter. I loved every second of it, and I cannot recommend this course enough. It is well detailed, well explained and has a lot of practicing to really understand the concepts. Thanks Max!

## Projects

Each project is focused on a different aspect of React. We practice it by building dummy pages that use the concept that we are working on, while also making use of the things we learnt along the way.

Some of the projects are not finished because I wanna come back to them once I think I need them for my personal projects, like Auth.
